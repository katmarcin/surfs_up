# Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to help W. Avy, an investor, predict whether opening a surf shop in Oahu, Hawaii would be a wise investment. To determine whether the investment into this business would be profitable, W. Avy would have to be certain that the business would be sustainable year-round to attract the most business possible. An examination of monthly weather is important to determine consistency, as people are more likely to surf if conditions are consistently good. This analysis helps prepare investors, like W. Avy, who seek to visualize trends prior to making business decisions.

A SQLite file containing a multitude of Hawaii weather metrics, such as precipitation and temperature, was provided as a resource. The programming language used in this analysis was Python, coupled with Pandas library. SQLAlchemy was imported in the code to extract functions and create session queries to obtain weather for the months of June and December. Altogether, for this project SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask were used in conjuction with each other to build on SQL database structure knowledge and querying methods.
